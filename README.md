# 🧾 TipTally

*The basic tip calculator for when you're splitting checks with friends*

## What's This About?

You know that moment when the check comes and everyone's pulling out their phones trying to figure out the tip and how to split it? Yeah, this fixes that. TipTally is a super clean, mobile-first tip calculator that just works – no fuss, no ads, no weird permissions.

Built this for my friends and me because we were tired of sketchy tip calculator apps. Now we just pull up [tiptally.app](https://tiptally.app) and we're good to go.

Yes, this was vibe coded.

## Features That Actually Matter

- **Clean & Fast**: Loads instantly, works on any phone
- **Smart Splitting**: Handles tip and total per person automatically
- **Custom Tips**: Sometimes you want to tip that server extra, or maybe just round numbers
- **No Scrolling**: Everything fits on your screen (because nobody wants to scroll when they're trying to pay)
- **Works Offline**: Once it loads, you're set even if the restaurant WiFi is trash

## Tech Stack

Built with the good stuff:
- **Next.js 15** - Because it's 2024 and we like fast websites
- **Tailwind CSS** - For that clean, modern look
- **TypeScript** - Keeping bugs away from dinner time
- **Radix UI** - Accessible components that just work

## The Story

Made this after one too many awkward moments trying to calculate tips on crappy restaurant calculator apps. Wanted something that:
- Loads fast
- Looks good
- Does the math right
- Doesn't make you feel like you need a computer science degree

Now when we go out, someone just opens tiptally.app on their phone and we figure out the split in like 10 seconds. Game changer.
