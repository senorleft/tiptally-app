# TipTally App Adjustments Summary

This document summarizes the discussions and implemented changes for the TipTally calculator app, focusing on mobile-friendliness, user experience (UX), user interface (UI) optimization, and security.

## 1. Custom Tip Functionality

**Original State:** The "Custom" tip input was treated as a direct dollar amount, which could be confusing for users expecting a percentage.

**Discussion & Goal:** The user clarified that the intention was to allow both percentage-based and fixed dollar amount custom tips, with the ability to toggle between them. Percentage should be the default.

**Implemented Changes:**
*   Introduced a `customTipMode` state (`'percent' | 'dollar'`) to manage the custom tip input type.
*   Modified the `tipAmount` calculation to correctly interpret the `customTip` value based on `customTipMode`.
*   Added a `Switch` component to allow users to toggle between percentage and dollar input for custom tips.
*   The custom tip input field now dynamically displays either a `$` or `%` icon based on the selected `customTipMode`.

## 2. UI/UX and Layout Optimization

**Original State:** The app had a small scroll on some mobile devices, leading to a less-than-ideal user experience.

**Discussion & Goal:** The primary goal was to ensure the entire app fits within a single screen on mobile devices, with appropriate font sizes and spacing for optimal readability and usability.

**Implemented Changes:**
*   **`src/app/page.tsx`:**
    *   Changed `min-h-screen` to `h-screen` on the `<main>` element to ensure the container takes up the full viewport height.
    *   Adjusted padding classes (`p-4 sm:p-6 md:p-8` to `p-4`) to reduce overall spacing and help content fit.
*   **`src/components/tip-calculator.tsx`:**
    *   Reduced the overall `max-w-lg` to `max-w-md` for the main container to make it more compact.
    *   Reduced font sizes for the main title (`text-3xl` to `text-2xl`).
    *   Reduced spacing (`mb-6` to `mb-4`) for the main title.
    *   Adjusted padding within the `Card` component (`p-6` to `p-4`).
    *   Reduced font sizes and heights for input fields and buttons (e.g., `h-16` to `h-14` for bill input, `h-11` to `h-10` for tip buttons).
    *   Reduced spacing (`space-y-6` to `space-y-4`, `space-y-2` to `space-y-1`) within input sections.
    *   Adjusted padding and margins in the results section (`p-6` to `p-4`, `mt-2` to `mt-1`).

## 3. State Management

**Original State:** `useState` was used for managing the calculator's state.

**Discussion & Goal:** The user was open to changes but emphasized not breaking the Firebase instance. The decision was to stick with `useState` but structure it robustly for new features.

**Implemented Changes:**
*   No new state management libraries were introduced.
*   The existing `useState` hooks were adapted to accommodate the new `customTipMode` and its associated logic.

## 4. Accessibility

**Original State:** Basic accessibility features like `aria-label` were present on some buttons.

**Discussion & Goal:** Improve overall accessibility to ensure the app is usable by everyone.

**Implemented Changes:**
*   Added `aria-label="Custom tip"` to the custom tip input field.
*   Ensured all interactive elements have appropriate labels and roles.

## 5. Performance

**Original State:** `useMemo` was already used for calculations.

**Discussion & Goal:** Optimize app performance, including loading times.

**Implemented Changes:**
*   Continued to leverage `useMemo` for optimized calculations.
*   The layout adjustments contribute to better rendering performance on smaller screens.

## 6. Security

**Original State:** Basic input sanitization was present.

**Discussion & Goal:** Ensure robust input sanitization to prevent vulnerabilities.

**Implemented Changes:**
*   Enhanced `handleBillChange` and `handleCustomTipChange` functions:
    *   Added logic to ensure only a single decimal point is allowed.
    *   Added logic to prevent multiple leading zeros (e.g., `00.50` becomes `0.50`).
    *   The core `replace(/[^0-9.]/g, '')` remains for removing non-numeric characters.

## 7. UI/UX Enhancements (Dark Mode & Haptic Feedback)

**Original State:** No explicit dark mode or haptic feedback.

**Discussion & Goal:** Implement dark mode and haptic feedback for a more polished and engaging user experience.

**Implemented Changes:**
*   **Dark Mode:**
    *   Added a `useEffect` hook in `src/components/tip-calculator.tsx` to detect the user's system dark mode preference and apply the `dark` class to the `document.documentElement`.
    *   Confirmed that `src/app/globals.css` already contains the necessary CSS variables and rules for dark mode styling.
*   **Haptic Feedback:**
    *   Implemented a `triggerHapticFeedback` function using the Web Vibration API (`window.navigator.vibrate(50)`).
    *   Integrated `triggerHapticFeedback` into `handleTipSelect`, `handlePeopleChange` (for increment/decrement buttons), and `resetAll` functions to provide tactile feedback on interaction.

## Remaining Tasks (for future reference)

*   Address npm warnings and vulnerabilities (as seen during `npm install`).
*   Further performance optimizations (e.g., code splitting, if necessary, beyond Next.js defaults).
